# Project Overview
This project addresses the classification of the Shuttle Control System into 7 different classes, using a neural network model.
The workflow includes:

- Data exploration and preprocessing

- Balancing strategies for highly imbalanced classes

- Feature selection

- MLP model training

- Cross-validation

- Performance evaluation and interpretation

# Dataset Description

The Statlog (Shuttle) dataset consists of: 9 numerical input variables, a single target variable with 7 output classes, a total of 58,000+ records and a strong class imbalance (Class 1 represents ~80% of the dataset)
The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
